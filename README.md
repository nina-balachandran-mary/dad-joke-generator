Introduction
This project is focused on frontend software development and understanding your level of comfort building websites and
applications that consume APIs.
For this project, you can use any frontend web technology you prefer. Vue, Angular, React, Vanilla - pick whatever you enjoy or are
most comfortable with. This project is less about your design skills and more about seeing your approach to building a website.

Task
Who doesn’t like a good dad joke??
We definitely love our dad jokes, and for this project we’d love for you to build a simple website containing - you guessed it - dad
jokes!
Since we’re not all experts at dad jokes, we would like you to use the following website and its freely available API to help provide the
dad jokes for your site: https://icanhazdadjoke.com
The API and its documentation can be found here: https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api

Core Requirements
You can build the website however you want, using any web technology you prefer, but the website must contain the following items:
1. Ability for users to search for a joke based on some user input
2. Ability for users to retreive a random joke on demand
3. Selecting a joke should take you to a dedicated page for that joke (silly, we know)
4. A header, footer, and navigation for accessing the pages you build
5. At least one additional feature of your choosing that is not specified above
   a. Example ideas: a way for users to share jokes with others, a way to keep track of previous joke searches, top jokes, etc
   The above 5 items are the core requirements for this task, but if you wish to add some bonus features - you are welcome to get
   creative!
